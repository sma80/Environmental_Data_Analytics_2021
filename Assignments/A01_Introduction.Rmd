## 1) Discussion Questions

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: I took Statistics for Natural Sciences last semester with Professor Poulsen. I also completed my undergraduate thesis using R (but have forgotten most of that, conveniently). 

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I feel pretty confident with the basics of R.

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: I generally struggle with the idea of "the Cloud", so the Github aspect of the course continues to confuse me and I am definitely worried I will accidentally delete or fail to save something important this semester.


## 2) GitHub

Provide a link below to your forked course repository in GitHub. Make sure you have pulled all recent changes from the course repository  and that you have updated your course README file.
